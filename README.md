# Cryptocurrencies

An important client has asked that we classify trading cryptocurrency assets for their advisory firm to better organize the total universe of these assets.  By clustering the data, we drop assets without total data, are not trading currently, and do not have coins currently being mined.<br>

After preprocessing our data, we have a clean dataset to classify. After reducing data dimensionality with PCA, we can use K-means to group the coins.<br>

The below elbow test indicates we should have 4 classes of coins.<br>
